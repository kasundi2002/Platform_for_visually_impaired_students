# Platform_for_visually_impaired_students
This is a platform for visually impaired students to learn subjects like mathematics and science. AI/ML , TTS and STT is used.

For students to learn about shapes and identify them "A gemetric object detection" feature is introduced in this platform. We have used AL/ML concepts to implement this feature.

My Part(Kasundi)- To ask questions from the teachers and get answers to those questions we have implemented a function "Student-Tutor Forum". This feature includes 
Text to speech and Speech to text functionality. Students can also upload images , audio to subject related questions. Teachers are able to reply to the questions asked by questions which students can use Text-to-speech function to listen to them.

Also our system allows tutors to upload questionairres , tutorials , exams to the website. Students can use voice based commands to answer the questions. their scores are displayed and announced after the exam is over.
